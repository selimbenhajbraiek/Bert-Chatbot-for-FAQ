# 🧠 FAQ Chatbot using BERT & Hugging Face Transformers


🚀 Overview

If you have a company and want to add a smart FAQ Chatbot, it’s easier than you think!
This project uses Hugging Face Transformers and a pretrained BERT model (fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset) to create a chatbot that can answer real questions from a text context.

Just modify the context variable with your company information — and the chatbot is ready to go! 

✨ Features

📚 Built using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

💡 Uses Hugging Face Transformers for tokenization and inference

🧩 Based on the SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)

🔢 Works with token IDs, start_logits, and end_logits to locate answers

🔍 Extracts the most relevant answer span directly from your custom text context

⚡ Easy to customize — just replace the context variable
